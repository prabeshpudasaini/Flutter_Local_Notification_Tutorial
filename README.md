# Flutter Local Notification


The Flutter Local Notification App is built using Flutter.

Notifications are an essential component of many apps. Local notifications  in particular have many use cases, though most commonly they're used to create scheduled reminders. There is an endless variety of apps you can make with this as a core or an additional feature. Notifications are platform specific and require us to tap into native code to create them. Fortunately, we donâ€™t have to become native developers to implement them into Flutter apps. Thanks to the powerful Awesome Notifications plugin, we can create notifications for iOS and Android with minimal effort!
